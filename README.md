# Pizza_sales_project
In this Pizza Project, we aim to analyze various aspects of the pizza restaurant's operations by querying the database. The following SQL queries will provide valuable insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and menu popularity. These queries include:

1. Total Number of Orders: A query to retrieve the total count of orders placed, giving us an overview of customer activity.
2. Total Revenue from Pizza Sales: This calculation helps us understand the overall revenue generated from pizza sales.
3. Highest-Priced Pizza: By identifying the most expensive pizza, we can assess pricing strategies and customer preferences.
4. Most Common Pizza Size Ordered: This query helps determine the most popular pizza size, which can inform inventory and marketing decisions.
5. Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types: We will identify the five most ordered pizzas, along with the quantities sold, to evaluate menu performance and customer preferences.
